### The increasing popularity of bike-sharing services in New York City has presented unique challenges in the efficient distribution of bikes across the city. Citi Bike, a leader in eco-friendly urban transportation, has experienced growing demand, especially since the Covid-19 pandemic, leading to frequent availability issues at various stations. This project aims to analyze user behavior and operational data to diagnose and address these distribution challenges, ensuring an optimized experience for all users.
